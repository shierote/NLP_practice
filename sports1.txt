DANBURY — When the Darien baseball team saw its draw in the CIAC Class LL tournament, the players and coaches could not believe it.

Not only was the Blue Wave matched up with a FCIAC team for the third-straight season, they were matched up against the same FCIAC team for the third-straight season.

Danbury. The team which knocked Darien out in the opening rounds in 2017 and 18.

And for the third season in-a-row Darien handed the ball to ace Henry Williams.

Williams made sure his senior season did not end to the Hatters, tossing a complete game as No. 19 Darien beat No. 14 Danbury 4-0 in the CIAC opening round Wednesday afternoon.

“I wanted the ball a lot. They have knocked me specifically out of states two years in a row,” Williams said. “To get them today and in the FCIAC quarterfinals, as a pitcher, you can’t have the same approach. I was heavily curveball earlier this year and this time it I used my fastball more and was able to locate it. This feels great. I haven’t (advanced in states). I’m excited.”

Darien will face either No. 3 Southington or No. 30 New Britain in the second round. The Southington-New Britain game was suspended in the bottom of the 10th inning with the score tied at 2.
